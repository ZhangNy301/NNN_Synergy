# NNN_Synergy
Official PyTorch implementation of "Synergy Over Supremacy" (MedIA). NNN is a framework for 3D medical segmentation that dynamically fuses complementary architectures (CNN, Transformer, SSM). It achieves SOTA robustness and accuracy by adapting to dataset-specific challenges, moving beyond single-model limitations.
